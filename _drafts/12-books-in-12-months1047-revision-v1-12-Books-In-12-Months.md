At the beginning of this year I decided to read 12 books. One book for each month. It’s not a crazy amount, but just enough to get me started and consistent in reading and read more. I decided that this year theme going to be about startup as that is what I’ focusing to do in my life this year. Thus, I find all the books that are related to startup or the one that could help my character as a startup founder and started buying them from Amazon.

Out of 12 books, these are the top 3 that I would highly recommend:  
1\) [Elon Musk: Inventing the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25541028-elon-musk)  
2\) [Pitch Anything: An Innovative Method for Presenting, Persuading, and Winning the Deal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10321016-pitch-anything)  
3\) [Get Backed: Craft Your Story, Build the Perfect Pitch Deck, and Launch the Venture of Your Dreams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25159544-get-backed)

Too many of them to list all of my reviews here, but here is one of them that I wrote on Goodread:

[![Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://i2.wp.com/i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1518291452l/25541028._SX98_.jpg?w=970&ssl=1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25541028-elon-musk)[Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25541028-elon-musk) by [Ashlee Vance](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/761595.Ashlee_Vance)  
My rating: [5 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1502215425)  
  
This is by far the most interesting biography I have ever read! Ashley Vance has done a very good job in bringing the readers into Elon Musk’s personal and professional life. Contrary to what most people think, I think Ashlee’s writing is very fair in showing and explaining Musk’s character. I now have a better understanding on some of Elon Musk’s interpersonal failures and my respect for him has never been greater after reading this book. Even though there are many places where you could read or watch his stories, this book is a totally a must have and read for those who adore Elon Musk and want to get to know him better.

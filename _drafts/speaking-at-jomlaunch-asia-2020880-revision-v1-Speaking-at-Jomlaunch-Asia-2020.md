Jomlaunch Asia is a conference for bootstrappers, indie hackers, solo founders, solo developers, indie SaaS in Asia founded by[ Iszuddin Ismail](https://twitter.com/iszuddin) or Dino. I did have a [chat session](https://ryzalyusoff.com/chat-with-iszuddin-ismail-from-jomweb/) with him talking about Reader Mode and my indie hacking journey back on May this year if you are interested on that.

But since the pandemic happened in 2020, they decided to held a virtual conference instead.

I was invited by Dino to give a talk there as one of the speakers and I decided to give a talk about my journey on how I bootstrapped my microstartup [Reader Mode](https://readermode.io) to profitability and named my talk as ‚ÄúBootstrapping with a Chrome Extension‚Äù. Not sure whether is the most suitable title but I just went with it. In the talk, I explained the process of how I got the idea, how I built, launch, grow and get the press etc for Reader Mode.

I suppose to give the talk at 3.45pm Malaysian time. And that means around 7.45am UK time. My original plan was to wake up early that day and started my talk, but I ended up not sleeping the whole night throughout the event instead üòÇ

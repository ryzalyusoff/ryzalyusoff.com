After almost 2 years of downsizing and getting rid lots of my possessions, I now literally own less than 100 things in my life. 66 to be exact. And except for my guitar, everything that I own now can be fit into one single backpack!

</figcaption></figure></div>So, for everyday wear, I got 8 of the same black v-neck t-shirts from ASOS. Yes, since 2 years ago, I have been wearing the same kind of shirt everyday. All black. By doing this, meaning I now have one less thing to think about each day that I woke up.

**Everyday Wear:**   
I have 8 t-shirts instead of 7, because I reserve one for when I go exercising/running. Same goes for my underware and socks.   
– 8 v-neck t-shirt from ASOS

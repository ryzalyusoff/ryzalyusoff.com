During the mid of September 2019, I was searching for an idea/project to build after my previously failed project [Veggsocial â€“](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/veggsocial) a social network for vegan and vegetarian. So the project was dying and I just had to sell it for a few quick bucks. My saving was low. And I also just been through a pretty bad breakup myself. I just didnâ€™t know what to focus on my life anymore and it was really a difficult time for me.

So while searching for an idea, I suddenly remembered the tweet that I saw from [Guilhermo](https://twitter.com/gvrizzo), posted few months before that. He mentioned in the tweet how he already reached $50,000 in sales with his Chrome extension â€“ Css Scan:

<center>> ðŸ¥‚ 4 months later, [@CssScan](https://twitter.com/CssScan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) just reached $50,000 in sales!  
>   
> It took 9 months to get $10k.  
> And just 4 months to get more $40k.  
>   
> Super happy to see this growth. Huge thanks to everybody who supported it and to my love [@LinAmelia8](https://twitter.com/LinAmelia8?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Also to [@gumroad](https://twitter.com/gumroad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), love them. ðŸ’– <https://t.co/wsxq79Nsm8> [pic.twitter.com/gLaa0DRkva](https://t.co/gLaa0DRkva)

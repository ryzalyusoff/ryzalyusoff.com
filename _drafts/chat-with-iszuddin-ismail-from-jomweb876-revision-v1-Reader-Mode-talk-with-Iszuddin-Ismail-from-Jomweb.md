Today I got a chance to converse with Iszuddin Ismail from [JomWeb](https://www.facebook.com/groups/jomweb)(A group focusing on IT, Web, Programming and Tech focusing on Malaysian scenes). He is the founder of that group in Facebook which now has around 26K+ members at the time of this writing. He is also the founder of [Jomlaunch](https://launch.jomweb.my/) and [Jomlaunch Asia](https://jomlaunch.asia/) among many others.

The session was held in the morning of 6am Malaysian Time or around 10pm UK time. And I was online with him talking about my experience of indiehacking and also my experience of building, launching and growing Reader Mode. The whole session lasted around 1 hour and you can find the full recorded version below.

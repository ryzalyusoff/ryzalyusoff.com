Earlier this month, I got news that my dad got stroke just after he received his first dose of covid-19 vaccine. My dad is 78 years old with multiple health issues, so whether or not it is the vaccine that caused the stroke or not, it is unknown.

Anyways, since I got some free time here during my 14-days quarantine, I decided to write up about my whole experience of going back to Malaysia from United Kingdom during this COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.

As a Malaysian citizen, what I need to do/bring with me when Iâ€™m going back to Malaysia from UK are:

- Negative COVID-19 PCR test result (within 3 days prior to departure date)
- Download MySejahtera mobile app
- Book hotel for quarantine (if you want to opt for Premium Quarantine Package). Then of course undergo the 14 days quarantine once I arrived

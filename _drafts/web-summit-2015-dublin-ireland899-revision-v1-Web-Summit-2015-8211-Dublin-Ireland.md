This is my first time attending Web Summit. I got two free open source contributor tickets, so I decided to go there with a friend as it was free! But still need to pay for plane tickets, hostel etc. But it was held in Dublin, Ireland so the ticket was cheap.

The plan was to attend the event just for a some times and then spend the rest exploring the city as I never been to Dublin or Ireland before. But as it turned out, we didnâ€™t get enough time to explore the city as we spent most of the time at the event itself.

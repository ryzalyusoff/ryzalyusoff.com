I started working on [Reader Mode](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/reader-mode) in November 2019 last year as a means to pay the bills and survive as an indie maker. Fast-forward 6 months later, it has been used by more than 19,000 people! Following the incredible growth that itâ€™s been having and after months of hard work, I am now introducing a new line of product: **Reader Mode Premium**.

The ultimate key difference between this **Premium** version vs **Free** and **Pro** version is that all saved articles will be stored in the unlimited cloud storage that comes with each Premium account. This move has let Reader Mode as product to unleash a whole new spectrum of features such as:   
â€“ Sharable articles in Reader Mode format   
â€“ Read-it-later mode   
â€“ Research mode   
â€“ Full-text search   
â€“ Favourites  
â€“ Tags for articles   
â€“ Sync styles &amp; settings   
â€“ Organization folders   
â€“ Citation generator

Thatâ€™s a lot of features! While still being a fully cuztomizable distraction-free reader with accessibility supports and research tools, it is also now the best all-rounded online reading toolkit that is perfect for anyone that is looking to organize their research , work, studies and online content in general.

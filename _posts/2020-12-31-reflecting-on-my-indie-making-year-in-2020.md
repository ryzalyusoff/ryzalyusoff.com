What a year 2020 has been. I remember when I was a kid, 2020 was described as this super modern environment in Malaysia where flying car is finally a thing. Malaysia was supposed to be the first-world country by now. I never imagine that in 2020 that I won’t actually be there in Malaysia and be in the UK instead. And I was for sure didn’t imagine that there’s a pandemic affected the whole 6 billion of the world population. If I could sum-up 2020 in a word, it will be “different”. Different from what I was imagining it would have become. Just totally different.

But if there’s one thing that I would be thankful for this year, it would be for my indie making journey has finally started to take off this year.

I’ve started indie-making 10 years ago actually when I first got into university. But there’s no term for it back then. And i didn’t really think that it is possible to make your actually app/startup that really took off. I thought it was either super lucky, or really only certain people can pull it off.

When I got to the UK I still think that way. But i was started to believe that I could do it especially when I joined the accelerator program indirectly etc. But in 2018 that all changed for good. I no longer found that it is impossible. I met all these amazing indiehackers all around the world through and we;ve made amazing connections. Thanks to sites like Twitter ,ProductHunt, Indiehackers.

 <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></center>The above tweet was me doing my work at Nero cafe in Altrincham, UK – the town where I was living back then in 2018. I went there almost everyday. Hustling from usually 9/10am till they close at 6pm. I made some great connections there, meeting lots of different kind of people. And most of the stuffs there already know me and my favourites.

## Reader Mode

[Reader Mode](http://readermode.io/) has been my baby for the past year. Reader Mode has been my focus and what I spent most of my days on. [It was crowed 1st Product of The Day on Product Hunt and was featured on the front page and and top position of Hacker News](https://ryzalyusoff.com/how-i-got-my-startup-to-1-on-product-hunt-and-hacker-news/). It got [featured on Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/organize-browser-tabs?ref=readermode), among many [other publications](https://readermode.io/news). And most importantly, it has earned me enough income to pay for my rent, food etc.

## Met amazing indie hackers

I met a lot of amazing people whom mostly are indiehackers from Twitter. My followers at this time of writing has grown from 700+ to now 1600+.

<center>> Had a blast chatting with [@deadly\_onion](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [@homsiT](https://twitter.com/homsiT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) about [@ReaderMode](https://twitter.com/ReaderMode?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [@readwiseio](https://twitter.com/readwiseio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ~ Nice to meet you guys! 😁 [pic.twitter.com/IxQlQyg7Vj](https://t.co/IxQlQyg7Vj)

 <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></center>## Moved to my own place!

After had been living with either family/friends/housemates all my life, I now finally live on my own now for the very first time! [My new home now is a tiny 150sqft studio apartment](https://ryzalyusoff.com/my-150-sq-ft-micro-studio-apartment/). For a minimalist like me, I really really love this studio! It has everything that I need, and it is really cozy.

This year also has seen me [speaking at a conference for the very first time ever](https://ryzalyusoff.com/speaking-at-jomlaunch-asia-2020/). I spoke at Jomlaunch Asia conference in November about my journey on how I bootstrapped Reader Mode from just a side project into a profitable micro-startup. It was a fully online conference done via AirMeet platform, given the state of the world right now. But that’s what makes it so unique 🙂

In conclusion, 2020 has been a blessing for indiemaking journey and my life, eventhough the world in general has been in a really terrible situation because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a way, I feel really lucky to have gone through this year as a person, as this year is really unique in it’s own way. And will surely be remembered as a really strange and worst, but also a good and amazing year for me.

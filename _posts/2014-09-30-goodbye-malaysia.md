Malaysia has been my home for those 23 years I’ve been living my life. But on 6th September 2014, I’ve got to pack all my belongings and heading towards Manchester, United Kingdom. I boarded an Etihad flight with a friend (my housemate now) from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), transit in Dubai, and finally landed in Manchester, UK. It was a 14 hours flight.

The main reason for this moving is for pursuing my Master Degree in Computer Science at University of Manchester. But if I do this right, I’ll get to call UK my second/first home for the rest of my life.

Living here has opened myself to a lot of opportunities that I didn’t get to have when I was in Malaysia. For one, I now literally got the chance to see the world. A lot of countries now just a flight away from me. The chance that I never thought I’ll get in my lifetime. And now it’s a reality. Thanks to the scholarship I got from Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA). I won’t waste this opportunity away, I promise.

The first day I arrived, my friend and I just go around, exploring the city.
